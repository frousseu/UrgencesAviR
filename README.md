# UrgencesAviR

A spatial shiny app for learning about bird presence and environmental concerns in case of environmental emergencies.

### TODO

**Check if SAUVFLEUVE data is getting out, because apparently a lot of months are written "00" in the urgencesapp.RData (update: this is a bug in the original excel data file where date formats are not standard and not well interpreted by read_excel)**
